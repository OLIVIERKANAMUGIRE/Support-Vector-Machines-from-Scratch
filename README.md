#### SVM
This is the second part of support vector machine where we introduce the nonlinear structures in the data.
We us the "kernel trick" = moving our problem in a higher dimension space to solve it linearly.
We show the first three support vectors as well.
We use small dataset called t030 to test our algorithm
